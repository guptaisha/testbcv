/**
 * @fileoverview Detects video playback events in the Brightcove player and
 * sends a CustomEvent for each of them.
 *
 * Although the player is loaded in an IFRAME, Brightcover overwrites
 * `postMessage` with their own function, so you can't post messages between
 * the parent and frame windows.
 *
 * But the script is run in the context of the parent window. So CustomEvents
 * can be dispatched and they can be received in the main window.
